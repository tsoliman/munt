MT32Emu WinMM Driver
********************************

First-time Installation
-----------------------

 1) Copy mt32emu.dll into C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32 directory.
 2) Copy mt32emu.ini into C:\WINDOWS directory.
 3) Set PathToROMFiles variable in mt32emu.ini to point to correct location
    of your ROM files.
 4) Run mt32emu_drv_GUI.exe application and press "Install Driver" button.

To begin playing back MIDI through the emulator, perform the following:

 5) Open "Sounds and Audio Devices" from the Control Panel.
 6) In the "Audio" tab, select "MT-32 Synth Emulator" in the drop-down list for
    the MIDI playback device.
 7) To adjust emulation parameters run mt32emu_drv_GUI.exe application.
    The new parameters take effect after either restarting MIDI playback or
    Reopening your MIDI application.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can also use "Add Hardware wizard" if you like. The information file 
mt32emu.inf is provided. However, this way works on x86 Windows only.

 1) Unpack mt32emu.inf and mt32emu.dll. Remember the location of this directory.
 2) Open Control Panel.
 3) Double-click on "Add Hardware".
 4) Click "Next" until you come to a message asking you whether you have
    already installed the hardware.
 5) Select the "Yes" option and click "Next".
 6) A list of installed hardware will appear. Scroll to the bottom of the list
    and select the last entry, which should be something like "New Hardware".
    Click "Next".
 7) Select "Choose hardware manually from a list" and click "Next".
 8) Select "Sound, Video and Game Controllers" and click "Next".
 9) Click "Have Disk...".
10) In the window that pops up, click "Browse..." and choose the directory to
    which you unpacked the mt32emu.inf and mt32emu.dll files. Click "OK".
11) If a window pops up complaining about the lack of Windows Logo testing,
    click "Install Anyway" or similar.
12) "MT-32 Synth Emulator" should have appeared selected in a list.
    Click "Next" twice.
13) The driver *still* isn't Windows Logo tested, so click "Install Anyway" if
    necessary.
14) The driver should now have been installed; click "Finish".
15) A dialog box will recommend that you reboot. Go ahead if you enjoy that
    sort of thing, but it shouldn't be necessary for a fresh installation.

To begin playing back MIDI through the emulator, perform the following:

16) Open "Sounds and Audio Devices" from the Control Panel.
